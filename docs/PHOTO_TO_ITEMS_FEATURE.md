# Photo to Items Feature

## Overview

The Photo to Items feature leverages Google Gemini AI to automatically detect and catalog items from photographs. This revolutionary feature transforms the traditional manual inventory process into a streamlined, AI-powered workflow.

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Detection
- **Automatic Item Recognition**: Uses Google Gemini Vision API to identify furniture, electronics, and household items
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically categorizes items based on their type
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts color, material, condition, and other relevant metadata

### 2. Interactive Bounding Box Editor
- **View Mode**: Click to select/deselect detected items
- **Edit Mode**: Drag to move boxes, resize using corner handles
- **Draw Mode**: Draw custom bounding boxes using perfect-freehand for smooth strokes
- **Multi-Selection**: Support for single or multiple item selection

### 3. Streamlined Workflow
1. **Upload**: Drag & drop or select an image
2. **Analyze**: AI processes the image and detects items
3. **Review**: Edit bounding boxes and item details
4. **Save**: Add selected items to inventory with one click

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### PhotoToItems Component (`/components/ai/photo-to-items.tsx`)
The main orchestrator component that manages the entire workflow:
- Image upload handling
- AI analysis coordination
- State management via Jotai atoms
- Room assignment
- Batch item creation

#### BoundingBoxEditor Component (`/components/ai/bounding-box-editor.tsx`)
Advanced bounding box manipulation using perfect-freehand:
- Touch and mouse support
- Smooth drawing with pressure sensitivity
- Real-time box editing with visual feedback
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

#### Enhanced AI Service (`/lib/services/ai-service.ts`)
- Client-side image preprocessing and resizing
- Server-side API integration for secure AI processing
- Structured response parsing

### State Management (Jotai Atoms)

The feature uses comprehensive Jotai atoms for state management:

```typescript
// Core atoms
currentImageAtom - Current uploaded image file
imagePreviewUrlAtom - Object URL for image preview
aiAnalysisResultAtom - AI analysis results
detectedItemsAtom - Array of detected items
boundingBoxesAtom - Array of bounding boxes
selectedDetectedItemsAtom - Selected item indices
selectionModeAtom - 'single' | 'multi' | 'crop'
editMode - 'view' | 'edit' | 'draw'
```

### API Integration

#### `/api/ai/analyze` Route
Secure server-side endpoint that:
- Validates API key from environment
- Processes images with Google Gemini
- Returns structured item data with bounding boxes
- Handles errors gracefully

## User Experience

### Entry Points

1. **Main Navigation**: "Create Items" link with camera icon
2. **Items Page**: Prominent "Create from Photo" button
3. **Dashboard**: Featured call-to-action card
4. **Direct URL**: `/items/create`

### Visual Design

- Gradient accents for AI-powered features
- Intuitive icons (Camera, Sparkles, Zap)
- Clear progress indicators
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

### Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- Touch-friendly controls
- Clear visual feedback
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Usage Guide

### For End Users

1. **Take a Good Photo**:
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Include multiple items in frame
   - Keep items clearly visible

2. **Upload and Analyze**:
   - Click "Create from Photo" or navigate to `/items/create`
   - Upload image (drag & drop supported)
   - Click "Analyze with AI"

3. **Review and Edit**:
   - Click items to select/deselect
   - Switch to Edit mode to adjust boxes
   - Use Draw mode to add missed items

4. **Save to Inventory**:
   - Optionally select a room
   - Click "Add X Items to Inventory"
   - Items are created with AI-generated metadata

### For Developers

#### Adding New Features

1. **Extend Detection Capabilities**:
   - Modify the prompt in `/api/ai/analyze/route.ts`
   - Add new metadata fields to `DetectedItem` interface

2. **Customize UI**:
   - Modify `PhotoToItems` component for workflow changes
   - Extend `BoundingBoxEditor` for new interaction modes

3. **Add Post-Processing**:
   - Hook into `onItemsDetected` callback
   - Implement custom validation or enrichment

## Performance Considerations

- Images are resized client-side before upload (max 768px)
- Bounding box calculations use normalized coordinates (0-1)
- React rendering optimized with proper memoization
- Debounced drawing for smooth performance

## Security

- API key stored server-side only
- Image processing happens in secure API route
- No sensitive data exposed to client
- Rate limiting can be added to API routes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Processing**: Support multiple images at once
2. **Template Recognition**: Learn from user corrections
3. **OCR Integration**: Read text/labels on items
4. **3D Modeling**: Generate 3D representations
5. **Mobile App**: Native camera integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"AI service not configured"**
   - Ensure `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`

2. **Poor detection results**
   - Check image quality and lighting
   - Try different angles or distances

3. **Bounding boxes not appearing**
   - Refresh the page
   - Check browser console for errors

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug_ai', 'true')
```
