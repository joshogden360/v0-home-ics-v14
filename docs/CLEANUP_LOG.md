# AI Integration Cleanup Log

Date: December 18, 2024

## Files and Folders to Remove

### 1. Temporary Reference Implementation
- **Path**: `/src - temp/`
- **Reason**: This was a reference implementation from another project used to understand the working patterns
- **Important code**: All key patterns have been preserved in `docs/AI_INTEGRATION_REFERENCE.md`

### 2. Test Route
- **Path**: `/app/items/create-test/`
- **Files**:
  - `page.tsx`
  - `photo-to-items.tsx`
- **Reason**: Created for testing without authentication, no longer needed
- **Note**: The main `/items/create` route has the same functionality with proper auth

### 3. Debug API Route
- **Path**: `/app/api/ai/analyze-debug/`
- **Reason**: Was created for debugging, functionality merged into main route

### 4. Middleware Exception
- **Line to remove**: Line 28 in `middleware.ts` referencing `/items/create-test`
- **Reason**: No longer need to exclude this route from auth
